Hallhub Project — Installation Guide 

Prerequisites 

1. Node.js must be installed (LTS version). 
Verify installation by opening Command Prompt : 
node -v 
npm -v 

2. VS Code (recommended) with Live Server extension installed. 
Steps 
i. After Extracting the zip folder, go to hallhub-backend 
ii. Open terminal from that folder, make sure server.js in the same directory 
where the terminal is opened. 

3. Run: 
npm install 
This will read package.json and install all required libraries into 
node_modules/. 

4. In the same terminal, run: 
node server.js 
If everything is correct, a message should be seen like: Server is 
running on port 3000 
 
           Open browser and go to: http://localhost:3000 
 

5. If you want to open static files like home.html instead of running the 
Node.js backend: 
           Open the project in VS Code. 
 
           Right-click home.html → Open with Live Server. 
 
          The page will open at something like 
http://127.0.0.1:5500/home.html. 

6. To stop the Node.js server, press CTRL + C in the terminal.
